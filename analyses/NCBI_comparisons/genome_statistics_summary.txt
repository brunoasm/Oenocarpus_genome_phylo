GENOME ASSEMBLY STATISTICS FOR ARECACEAE AND CURCULIONIDAE

ARECACEAE (Palms)
-----------------
Of the 25 genome assemblies available for Arecaceae in NCBI,
12 (48.0%)
are high-quality (chromosome-level or scaffold N50 > 10 Mb). These high-quality assemblies
represent 6 species (0.23% of ~2,600
described palm species) from 5 genera (2.8% of
181 genera). At higher taxonomic levels, the assemblies span
2 of 5 subfamilies
(40%), 3 tribes, and 2 subtribes.
Within the tribe Cocoseae specifically, high-quality genomes represent 1
of 4 subtribes (25%) and
1 genus. The represented subfamilies are: Arecoideae, Coryphoideae.

CURCULIONIDAE (Weevils)
-----------------------
For Curculionidae, 95 genome assemblies are available in NCBI,
with 38 (40.0%)
meeting high-quality criteria. These assemblies represent 31 species
(0.061% of ~51,000 described weevil species) across
23 genera (0.50% of ~4,600 genera).
At the subfamily level, 6 of approximately 8
major subfamilies (75%) are represented by high-quality genome assemblies.
The represented subfamilies are: Ceutorhynchinae, Cryptorhynchinae, Entiminae, Molytinae, Platypodinae, Scolytinae.

COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE
-----------------------
Both families show relatively limited genomic sampling, with high-quality genomes representing
less than 1% of described species diversity in both cases. At the subfamily level, both families
show relatively good representation, with Curculionidae having 75% of major
subfamilies and Arecaceae having 40% of subfamilies represented by high-quality
genome assemblies. However, Curculionidae shows better coverage of subfamily-level diversity, likely
reflecting greater sequencing effort in this economically important family. The addition of genomes
for Oenocarpus mapora (Arecaceae: Cocoseae) and Anchylorhynchus bicarinatus (Curculionidae)
represents valuable contributions to the genomic characterization of these diverse plant and
insect families.
